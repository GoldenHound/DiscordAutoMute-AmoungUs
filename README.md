Discord Auto Mute for Among Us
Auto mutes discord users during among us games when not in meeting via client screen grab (discord library client not for bots)
Side note - this was built for an older version of discord and amoung us in 2021
You must edit the code, add your discord client token; discord name and #; chanel id; and change your deffen keybind to ctrl + l;
*DISCLAIMER* - Using discords bot api with client side (non bot) interactions is against discords python library TOS so use at your own disgression (however I had no issues)
This program uses discord python library along with pillow imaging python library (for the pixel screen grabs)
